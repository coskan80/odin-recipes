    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Like Kabobs, the word Souvlaki simply means “meat on skewers.” But Greeks
      also use it to describe the actual meal—warm pita, loaded with perfectly
      marinated grilled meat and topped with Tzatziki sauce. Other fixings are
      typically included, and even a handful of fries are tucked into the pita.
    </p>
    <p>
      What goes into this souvlaki recipe? Three simple things: an awesome Greek
      souvlaki marinade, quality chicken, and the pita fixings.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
      <ul>
        <li>500 g chicken breast, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lemon (juice and zest)</li>
        <li>teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>½ bunch of parsley</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>salt</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First, cut the chicken into pieces of the same size, as much as
        possible, and put them in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, in a blender, add the extra virgin olive oil, parsley, pepper,
        lemon juice and zest, oregano and thyme and mash.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then pour the chicken over the marinade, mix well and leave for 15-20
        minutes. At the end add the salt and mix again.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the chicken is marinating, you can cut the onion into slices, the
        tomato into pieces and prepare the french fries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Thread the chicken pieces in the metal straws and bake them in the
        barbecue or in the grill pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the skewers are ready, you can serve them in two ways:
        <ul>
          <li>
            either remove the skewer and wrap it with the baking paper in a
            pita, adding onion, tomato, fries and tzatziki
          </li>
          <li>
            either serve them as a portion with the pita cut on the plate and
            the vegetables, the fries and the tzatziki next to the meat!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

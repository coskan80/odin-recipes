    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Make a fresh and colourful Greek salad in no time. It's great with grilled
      meats at a barbecue, or on its own as a veggie main.

      Horiatiki, the real deal traditional Greek salad consists of a few simple
      ingredients: tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, red onions, olives, and
      blocks of creamy feta cheese. The vegetables are typically cut into large
      chunks, and there is no lettuce or other fillers added. A dash of kosher
      salt and dried oregano to season. And the dressing is typically a drizzle
      quality extra virgin olive oil and vinegar (I typically use red wine
      vinegar).

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a frying pan over a high heat. Drizzle 4 tbsp of the oil over the
        slices of aubergine and fry them in several batches for 5-7 mins or
        until golden brown and beginning to soften. If they look a little dry
        during cooking, add a dash more olive oil. Set aside on a plate lined
        with kitchen paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large flameproof casserole dish or saucepan
        over a medium-high heat. Add the mince and fry for 8-10 mins until a
        deep golden brown, regularly stirring and breaking up with a wooden
        spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oven to 200C/180 fan/gas 4. Bring a large pan of lightly salted
        water to the boil. Add the potato slices and cook for 6 mins, drain in a
        colander and leave to steam dry for 10 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the butter in a small saucepan, stir in the flour and cook over a
        medium heat for 1 min. Remove from the heat and whisk in the milk,
        pouring in a bit at a time, until smooth. Return to the heat and bring
        to a simmer, cooking for 3 mins. Remove from the heat and whisk through
        the parmesan, a little grated nutmeg and some seasoning, and finally the
        whole egg as well as the yolk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take a large rectangular ovenproof dish. Spoon a third of the meat into
        the dish and spread out evenly, followed by half the aubergine and half
        the potato, then the rest of the meat and another layer of aubergines,
        followed by potatoes. Finish with the béchamel, smoothing the top over
        with a palette knife. Put in the centre of the oven and cook for 50 mins
        or until deep golden brown. If it browns too much during cooking, cover
        the dish. Set aside for 10 mins to cool before serving.
